GENERAL:
- dropzone accepted file type
- return full filename, keep other files? (PRTs)
- file type based dispatch to corresponding analyzer in inspector 
  one analyzer (or we provide a variable in the get call) per file type, same interpreter 
- url/uri naming
- error handling
  * if no transcribe match, return trascribe and supported queries
- tests for interpreter, more pre-uploaded files
- tests for analyzer
- first two recordings in session seems to always fail, do nothing for empty audio
- pass on sample rate 
- test sample target rate effect on accuracy
- transcribe tonly (direct to interpreter)
- default file fall back
- enhance diagnostics (hint field in inspector response to display on frontend)
- sequence seems off: output of pcm downsampling sfter pcm size, also sometimes sends last buffer - reset buffer before rec starts
- donte interweace but average


PRT ANALYZER:
- elapsed time
- peak memory consumption
- serial/parallel/run type
- no wells/completions
- build date/type
- platform
- input/model/deck name
- fluid_system
- phases
- number connections/edges & nnc
- regions
- time steps
- non linears
- linears
